# Employe-Salary-Web-App
A Java Spring based web application for workers to check their salary.

This application is a conversion of a previous application built by me into a Spring web
application. The app was built using Spring Boot, Thymleaf, MySQL, HTML and some CSS.
The application includes form validation on the server side using a custom validator. If
the login details pass through the validation process sucessfully it will connect to a data source to check
for a user. Spring Security was implimented to provide some basic protection.
